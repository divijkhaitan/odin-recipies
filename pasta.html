                <ol>
                    <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.</p>/li>
                    <li><p> Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, and garlic; saute until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. 
                        Season with salt, pepper, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, and crushed red chili pepper. Add spinach and tomato towards the end of the saute process and cook until spinach 
                        has wilted.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Season ricotta cheese with more Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder. Stir seasoned ricotta cheese into the vegetable mixture with Parmesan cheese, 
                        lemon zest, and lemon juice. Heat over medium-high heat until heated all the way through, 3 to 5 minutes.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Plate and top with mozzarella.</p></li>
